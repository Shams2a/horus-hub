##### Connection Issue Detected! ‚ö†Ô∏è

We're experiencing difficulty retrieving data from the MQTT broker monitoring API, which may
result in the display of inaccurate or zero values.
This could indicate a potential issue with the MQTT broker or the monitoring system. Our
team is already investigating the problem.


Please be assured that we are actively working to resolve this issue.
In the meantime, you may experience limited or delayed updates on the dashboard.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience.


For immediate assistance or to report any concerns, please reach out to our support team at

##### Broker

The MQTT Dashboard utilizes the [HiveMQ MQTT\\
broker](https://www.hivemq.com/).
You can use any MQTT client or library to publish to the broker.

With our free, fully managed MQTT Cloud Platform [HiveMQ Cloud](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-cloud-broker/) you can create
reliable, scalable and secure MQTT cloud-broker clusters that are built for
production.
[Sign up](https://console.hivemq.cloud/) and you are
ready to connect up to 100 IoT devices at no cost (no credit card required).

##### Getting Started

If you are new to MQTT and want to know how it works take a look at the [MQTT\\
Essentials](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials/) which explains all the basics in a very digestible manner.

You can use our [MQTT\\
Websocket client](http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/)
to
publish and subscribe to the broker. A list of assorted MQTT client tools with
tutorials about their features can be found in the [MQTT Toolbox](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-toolbox/).


If you want to use MQTT in your software project you can take a look at the [MQTT Client\\
Library Encyclopedia](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-client-library-encyclopedia), which contains a range of HowTos on MQTT client
libraries for different programming languages.
